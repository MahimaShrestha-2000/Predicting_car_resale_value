Prediction of the resale value of a car using Linear Regression.

Project outline:
The project aims to predict the resale value of a car using Linear Regression. It follows multi-step process of :
- Data Gathering
- Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Building
- Testing the Assumptions of Linear Regressions
- Evaluating the model

An important part of this project is matching my model against the assumptions of Linear Regression. Having studied the
assumptions theoretically, I wanted to experiment for myself the actual process and the setbacks usually faced when building
a linear model.

This model is not perfect, but it's a Work In Progress.

Thank you.
